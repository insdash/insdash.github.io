# This Website

insdash's website built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) for scalability and performance.

Key advantages of using Astro:

- **Scalable architecture**: Easily add new pages or components without affecting site performance.
- **Framework flexibility**: Mix and match frameworks (Vue, React, Svelte, etc.) for specific parts of the site.
- **Performance-first**: Static HTML output by default, with hydration only where necessary.
- **SEO-friendly**: Automatic sitemap generation and fast-loading pages improve search engine visibility.
